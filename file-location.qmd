## Computer file structure

-   Your computer files and folders can all be accessed via the 'Terminal'.

-   This is the location of a file called `greeting.txt` on my computer.

-   The exact same file can be found via the terminal.

## Basics of the terminal

`ls` List files

`pwd` Print working directory

`cd` Change directories

`less` Show preview in terminal (quit by hitting "q")

`mv` Move file

`mkdir` Make a new folder or directory

### **Activity**

> Pull up the last document you opened on your computer. Repeat this in terminal. What is the path location of that file?

    less Desktop/secret_folder/topsecret/greetings.txt

### **Activity**

> How would you move a file titled "tmp.csv" from your current directory to one called archived-files?

    # mv [file] [location]

### **Activity**

> Create a new directory in `r-intro-docs` called _HELLO_. Move `greeting.txt` to that new directory. What is the full path of `greeting.txt`?

## Pro tips for organizing & naming files

-   Use a consistent theme in file naming

-   Do not use spaces or special symbols. Dashes and underscores are helpful! (avoid using periods in file names too)

-   Capitalization matters (and can be helpful)

-   _What else?_
