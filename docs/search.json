At any time raise your hand or use the ‘raise hand’ option remotely to ask a question.\nPlease note that learning R is similar to learning a whole new language. Additionally, we do not expect any prior experience for this course. Together, this means that each learner will have their own pace and experience during the course. Please be respectful of this and if you see how you can help someone, do so!\nFor instruction, we will be live coding the entire time. While most of the code is available on this website, the live coding aspect will help immerse you into coding in R. During each live coding session, the R script for each session will be saved and uploaded so you can access it in the future. This is because the code on this page is meant to be minimal, and during the coding sessions we will expand upon what is shown and document as we go along.\nIn order to keep a pulse on the pace of the class, please use the raising hand acknowledgement or the post it note approach to indicate to the instructor(s) that you need the content to slow down or you are stuck.\nSince we are all learning together, we will also use the term buddy up to take a pause and ask your direct neighbors for help or come together with the people around you to troubleshoot the problem."
