2.  What is a library?
3.  Examples of how we use R

Some exampled of 'executed code' and an output.

```{r}
1 + 4
```

```{r}
x <- (4 + 5)

x - 2
```


## What about other computing languages?

Discussion of coding examples, python, julia, and others..

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Transferable skill

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

## Thoughts & recommendations

Amount of time spent may seem not useful. 

## Common themes moving forward

1. Documentation: have current you write notes from past you to future you
2. Google it: no matter how you learned R or how advanced you are, you will ultimately be looking things up online. A part of this course will include 'how to learn R'.
3.
